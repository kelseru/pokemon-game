<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Following in the footsteps of Nintendo's popular Pok√©mon games, Pok√©mon Aurora is a tribute to the RPG genre and the beloved series.

The project was started shortly after learning how to use React and is still in development at the current time. It uses the RESTful Pok√©API to pull a vast array of data for certain Pocket Monsters, and guides the player through a short story and battle sequence.

‚ùóÔ∏èNote: This game is still in early development and may not function correctly.


### Built With
This game was built using:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com)
* HTML5
* CSS

The game was organised using Trello, with version control managed within GitHub and then hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Roadmap
The game was built only a few weeks into the bootcamp, so of course I'd love to make some improvements!
* Customisable character name
* Battle system
* Character movement and maps
* Menu and item functionality
